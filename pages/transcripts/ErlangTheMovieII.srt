1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,306
declarative programming languages

2
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:12,580
have several advantages

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,873
over traditional languages

4
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:14,873
for example

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,530
programs in such languages

6
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,018
are considerably shorter

7
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,521
than equivalent programs

8
00:00:19,577 --> 00:00:21,034
in imperative languages

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,373
here for example

10
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:23,947
is a program in C

11
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,128
and here is the equivalent program

12
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,086
in Erlang

13
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:31,071
(phone rings)

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,725
Hello

15
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,825
Hello, Joe

16
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,023
Hello, Mike

17
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:37,191
Question

18
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:38,533
does anyone care about

19
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,481
the differences between

20
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,794
declarative and imperative languages anymore?

21
00:00:42,036 --> 00:00:43,036
don’t be silly

22
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,045
the declarative/imperative debate

23
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,346
is always a crowd pleaser

24
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,502
from what I can tell

25
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,525
kids these days are going with what’s cool

26
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,737
like Node.js and Ruby on Rails

27
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,544
let’s ask Robert

28
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,475
(phone rings)

29
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,492
hello, Robert?

30
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:00,567
hello, Mike

31
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:01,892
Joe’s back to talking about

32
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:03,308
declarative languages again

33
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,042
I just think Erlang’s got a problem

34
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:06,066
when its spokesman

35
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,208
is an old fuddy-duddy

36
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,208
eh Joe?

37
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:08,950
bite me

38
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:10,177
Robert, what do you think?

39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,451
Erlang’s the shizzah!

40
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:12,735
but I can’t blame kids

41
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,451
for picking something a little less

42
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:15,268
crusty

43
00:01:15,354 --> 00:01:17,458
Erlang’s image is stuck in the 1980s

44
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,453
It’s the Bananarama of languages

45
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,081
okay

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,079
tell you what

47
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:23,932
this is bullshit

48
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:28,333
if kids these days

49
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,658
don’t want to use Erlang

50
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:30,612
which is the real

51
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:31,748
rock star tech

52
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:32,591
then fuck it

53
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:33,929
I’ll turn this video off

54
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:34,652
and go home

55
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,814
take my nine nines

56
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:36,274
with me

57
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,342
(video off)

58
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:39,057
Joe

59
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,946
I didn’t mean anything by it

60
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:41,852
yeah Joe

61
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:42,663
Mike was just

62
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,185
trying to be constructive

63
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,253
Joe

64
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,757
turn the video back on

65
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:48,739
I won’t

66
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,745
I won’t have Erlang disparaged!

67
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:51,887
yo yo yo

68
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,810
I can totally help you geezers

69
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:54,963
who said that?

70
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,022
all Erlang needs

71
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,164
is an image upgrade

72
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,060
that’s very interesting.

73
00:01:59,212 --> 00:01:59,928
lots of things

74
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,013
from the 80s are cool

75
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:01,917
just look at

76
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:02,508
Fraggle Rock

77
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,916
and Super Mario Brothers

78
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,952
what the hell is that

79
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:05,919
it’s one of those

80
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:06,926
Ruby hipsters

81
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:08,088
watch it grandpa

82
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:10,075
just because I carry my Mac 

83
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:11,151
in a messager bag

84
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,748
and have great taste in nose rings

85
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,132
doesn’t mean I use Ruby

86
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:15,135
I for one

87
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:15,871
and interested in

88
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:16,817
what the little girl

89
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:17,480
has to say

90
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:18,698
yo, whatever

91
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,319
first we have to fix the name

92
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,431
a language named after

93
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,424
a nineteenth century

94
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:23,560
Danish mathematician

95
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:24,494
is about as cool

96
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:25,973
as having a Facebook account

97
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,807
it’s just like the olden days

98
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,285
when Erlang was banned

99
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,622
we had to change the name

100
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,651
that’s right

101
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,988
when Erlang fell out of fashion

102
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:33,769
at Ericsson

103
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,082
we changed the name

104
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:36,146
to OTP

105
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:37,625
three of the trendiest names

106
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,642
we could think of

107
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:39,612
Open

108
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:40,606
Telecom

109
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:41,410
Platform

110
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,522
gives me the chills

111
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:43,847
just thinking about it

112
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:44,486
okay

113
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:45,468
that’s bullcrap

114
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,461
no one care about

115
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:47,633
telecom platforms

116
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:48,993
we need something fresh

117
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,058
something edgy

118
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:51,903
like Erlang on Rails

119
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,015
Jesus Christ

120
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,405
The last thing you want to do

121
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:55,156
is imitate

122
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,741
no. something original.

123
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:57,484
how about

124
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:58,863
Erlang++?

125
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,148
I got it

126
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,616
we keep OTP

127
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,354
but with a hip

128
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:03,366
edgy twist

129
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:04,037
check it

130
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:04,776
your language

131
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:05,927
will hereby be known as

132
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,732
Outlaw

133
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:07,787
Techno

134
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,832
Psychobitch

135
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,419
it does spell OTP

136
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:13,919
don’t know what it has to do

137
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,764
with software

138
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:15,792
what do you think

139
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:16,694
Joe?

140
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,083
I absolutely love it

141
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:21,020
that name is fucking gangster

142
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,848
yeah, Joe

143
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,653
you rule

144
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:23,326
okay

145
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:24,267
next thing we need

146
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,185
is a video that is

147
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:25,905
just as cool as

148
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,305
the original Erlang The Movie

149
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,417
but speaks to today’s

150
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,376
programmer hipster

151
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,664
I’m thinking something

152
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:31,384
like this

153
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:46,953
yo, what up bitches

154
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:47,761
Rex here

155
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:48,250
this time

156
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,016
I’m talking about

157
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:49,483
a bad ass

158
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:50,080
new language

159
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,095
called Outlaw Techno Psychobitch

160
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,766
or OTP for short

161
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:55,084
so you all know

162
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,193
I’m a huge Ruby fan

163
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,820
Ruby gives you 15 ways

164
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,745
to do the same thing

165
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,267
and freedom of choice is good

166
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:01,386
then I realized

167
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,063
that’s just 15 different ways

168
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:04,461
to create really slow

169
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,540
crappy programs

170
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,714
then I started using Node.js

171
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:08,733
I like Node because

172
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,141
as my hero Ryan Dahl says

173
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,792
it’s like coloring with crayons

174
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,518
and playing with Duplo blocks

175
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:14,807
but as it turns out

176
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:15,558
it’s less like

177
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:16,762
playing with Duplo blocks

178
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:17,727
and more like

179
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,328
playing with slinkies

180
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:21,333
slinkies that get tangled together 

181
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,731
and impossible to separate

182
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:24,079
so then I checked out

183
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,720
Outlaw Techno Psychobitch

184
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:27,212
It’s a language out of Sweden

185
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,988
that can be used to build web scale,

186
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:29,898
asynchronous,

187
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:30,704
non-blocking,

188
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:31,515
sharded,

189
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:32,331
event-driven,

190
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:33,216
message passing,

191
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:33,952
NoSQL,

192
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:34,659
reliable,

193
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:35,594
highly available,

194
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:36,524
high performance,

195
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:37,201
real-time,

196
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,006
clusterable,

197
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:38,499
bad ass,

198
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:39,265
rock star,

199
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:40,120
get the girls,

200
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,210
get the boys

201
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,219
impress your mom,

202
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,175
impress your cat

203
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,025
applications

204
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:47,910
Ryan Dahl

205
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:48,945
my hero says

206
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,104
we should not be supporting

207
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:51,601
more programming languages

208
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,118
that we should be killing them

209
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,177
that all these bullshit

210
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:55,685
projects are confusing people

211
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:57,162
but Psychobitch is just

212
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,018
so damn cool

213
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:58,878
I couldn’t resist

214
00:04:58,878 --> 00:04:59,634
giving it a try

215
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:03,688
the first thing

216
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:04,956
Psychobitch kills off

217
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:06,235
is curly braces

218
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:07,175
thank God

219
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:08,538
after a half century of

220
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:09,508
curly braces

221
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:10,876
we need something that’s fresh

222
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:12,666
Psychobitch uses single character

223
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:13,676
block delimiters

224
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:14,736
like in sentences

225
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:20,411
my hero Ryan Dahl says

226
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,769
math is not necessary

227
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:22,839
that people who think

228
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,311
it’s superior to curly braces

229
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:24,779
are wrong

230
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:25,863
but, I figure

231
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,092
if math can get a rover

232
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:27,634
to Mars

233
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:28,892
maybe it can help us

234
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:29,952
write better programs

235
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:34,757
Psychobitch gets

236
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:36,209
pretty uptight about logic

237
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:36,871
if you say

238
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:37,652
that X is one

239
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:38,806
and then turn around

240
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,069
and say X is two

241
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,313
Psychobitch goes ape shit

242
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:42,009
she’s like

243
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:42,850
what the hell

244
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,471
when did one start equalling two?

245
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:49,888
Psychobitch has this great feature

246
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:51,152
called pattern matching

247
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,510
you define the patterns

248
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,515
and if there’s a match

249
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:54,766
your program keeps going

250
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,411
if something doesn’t match

251
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,307
it crashes

252
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,936
like assertions but built-in

253
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,148
what happens when your program crashes?

254
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,776
Psychobitch has you covered

255
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,014
it monitors your code

256
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:10,848
and restart things that break

257
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,225
it’s like the Terminator

258
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,593
you can blast it in the face

259
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:14,552
with a shot gun

260
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:15,729
it stops for a second

261
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,377
then keeps on coming

262
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,303
I’ve written a chat server

263
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:23,317
in Psychobitch

264
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,803
it’s where all my friends and me

265
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,243
can chat about how awesome

266
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:27,060
Ryan Dahl is

267
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,054
because the server is written in Psychobitch

268
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,283
it can easily handle

269
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,919
thousands of concurrent users

270
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:32,763
shit

271
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:34,162
did I say thousands

272
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:35,074
because I meant

273
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:36,432
tens of thousands

274
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:38,459
and by tens of thousands

275
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,047
I mean

276
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:40,763
hundreds of thousands

277
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:45,750
I’m already logged in as myself

278
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,500
at the top

279
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,620
I’ll log in as another user

280
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,392
you say something using the “tell” command

281
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,404
the messages are received instantly

282
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:54,182
even though there are

283
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,126
hundreds of thousands of connected users

284
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:57,782
I’ll use the “yell” command

285
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,844
to broadcast a message to every user

286
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:02,338
that literally sent the message

287
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,733
to 300,000 users

288
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,846
about a second

289
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:09,281
okay

290
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:11,770
300,000 concurrent users is impressive

291
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:13,879
but even Node.js can do that

292
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,457
let’s try something hard

293
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:16,882
to make things interesting

294
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,802
we’ll trigger a bug

295
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:18,549
on the server

296
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:20,526
damn

297
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,272
I must have said something bad

298
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,465
but as you can see

299
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,234
Mary and Jack can still chat

300
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:27,490
of the 300,000 users on the server

301
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:28,892
I’m the only one affected

302
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,258
let’s see

303
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:31,429
if we can fix the bug

304
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:32,687
here’s the code

305
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,700
holy crap

306
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:35,548
it looks like

307
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:36,741
the original programmer

308
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:37,474
in his zeal

309
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:39,026
added some forbidden utterances

310
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,421
let’s clean this up

311
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,873
because we don’t want to censor

312
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,476
okay

313
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,157
I recompiled the code

314
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,660
next, I’ll reload it

315
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,731
in real time

316
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,210
with 300,000 concurrent chats going on

317
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,172
done

318
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:54,731
in case you missed it

319
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:55,543
here it is again

320
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,729
in slow motion

321
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:04,109
for some of you

322
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,328
what you just saw

323
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,088
is not self explanatory

324
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,574
if gracefully handling bugs

325
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:09,965
with hundreds of thousands of

326
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,092
concurrent sessions

327
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,525
and fixing them in real time

328
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,636
without stopping the server

329
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:14,589
seems passe

330
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,866
you can aways use Ruby

331
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,727
then, when your app doesn’t scale

332
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,870
move to Node.js

333
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:20,852
then, when you can’t maintain your code

334
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:22,688
because it’s a pile of tangled slinkies

335
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:24,003
move to Psychobitch

336
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,089
with that experience

337
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:26,842
you can appreciate what you just saw

338
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:27,833
for the rest of you

339
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:28,639
yes

340
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:29,719
that just happened

341
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:35,061
So

342
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,922
what do you guys think about Psychobitch?

343
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:38,542
she’s utterly terrifying

344
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,060
it makes me wonder if perhaps

345
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,877
Psychobitch is a real person

346
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:42,378
you mean

347
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:43,992
is the name based on my experience

348
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:45,827
with a girlfriend who’s bat shit crazy

349
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:46,983
drop dead gorgeous

350
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:47,638
brilliant

351
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:48,825
and brags to her friends

352
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:49,632
about costing me

353
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,030
tens of thousands of dollars

354
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,741
in therapy

355
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,049
over the last three years

356
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:54,301
oh shit

357
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,717
I know a girl like that

358
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:57,438
she scarred me for life

359
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:58,372
literally

360
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:00,678
seriously

361
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:02,234
I’ll show you the scars
